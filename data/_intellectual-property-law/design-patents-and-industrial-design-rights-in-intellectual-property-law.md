Intellectual property (IP) law protects the creative and inventive work of individuals and businesses by providing exclusive rights to use and commercialize such creations. Design patents and industrial design rights are two forms of IP protection that are critical to creators of new products and designs. In this article, we will explore these two types of intellectual property and compare their benefits and limitations. 

## What are Design Patents? 

A design patent is a legal protection for the ornamental design of a functional item. In other words, a design patent focuses on how a product looks, not how it works. To qualify for a design patent, the design must be original, non-obvious, and distinctive. A design patent gives the owner the exclusive right to use, sell, or license the design for a period of 15 years from the date of grant. 

## What is Industrial Design Rights?

Industrial design rights are similar to design patents, but they are granted in different countries. It is an exclusive right granted to the creator of a design for a product, which gives the owner the right to prevent others from using, making, and selling the design. The design must be new and have an industrial or commercial application. Industrial designs protect the aesthetic features of a product, such as shape, pattern, or color. 

## Differences between Design Patents and Industrial Design Rights

The main difference between design patents and industrial design rights is that a design patent is granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), while industrial design rights are granted in other countries around the world. Moreover, design patents are applicable within the United States only, while industrial design rights are applicable in the specific countries where they are granted. 

Another difference lies in the duration of the protection. A design patent is valid for 15 years from the date it is granted, while the term of protection offered by industrial design rights can vary depending on the country where it is granted.

There are some similarities between the two types of intellectual property protection. Both design patents and industrial design rights are critical to protecting the unique features of a product from being copied. Design patents and industrial design rights both require that the design be new and non-obvious. 

## Why seek Design Patents or Industrial Design Rights?

Owners of product designs look to secure design patents or industrial design rights for a variety of reasons. Some of the key reasons may include:

- *Protect Products From Infringement:* Registration of the design with the USPTO (in the case of a design patent) or with the applicable country registry (in the case of industrial design rights) provides notice to the public of the owner's rights in the design. This helps deter others from copying the design and infringing on the rights of the owner. 

- *Gain Exclusive Rights:* Obtaining a design patent or industrial design right gives the owner exclusive ownership of the design for a limited period of time. This means that no one else can use, make, or sell the design without the owner's permission.

- *Generate Revenue:* Owners of product designs can license or sell their rights. This allows the owner to generate revenue from the rights while retaining ownership of the design.

## Conclusion

Design patents and industrial design rights provide essential legal protection to the creators of new products and designs. While there are differences in the scope, term, and registration process of these two types of intellectual property protection, both are essential tools for creators to protect and monetize their designs. Consider seeking the advice of an experienced IP attorney to help identify the best strategy for protecting your product designs.
