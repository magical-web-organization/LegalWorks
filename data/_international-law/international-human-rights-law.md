International human rights law is a body of legal rules and standards that aim to promote and protect human rights around the world. It is a subset of international law, which governs the relationships between countries and other international actors.

Human rights refer to the basic rights and freedoms that all human beings are entitled to, regardless of their race, sex, religion, or other characteristics. These rights include the right to life, liberty, and security, the right to freedom from discrimination, and the right to a fair trial.

## History

The modern human rights movement began after World War II, when the international community came together to establish a framework for protecting human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948, is widely regarded as the foundation of modern international human rights law. Since then, a number of treaties and conventions have been adopted to further elaborate on and strengthen the principles outlined in the Declaration.

## Purpose

International human rights law serves several purposes:

- To promote and protect human rights around the world
- To hold states and other actors accountable for human rights violations
- To provide a framework for cooperation between states and other international actors in promoting and protecting human rights
- To help ensure that human rights are respected in the context of armed conflict, detention, and other situations where they may be at risk.

## Major Treaties and Conventions

There are several major treaties and conventions that make up international human rights law. These include:

- The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
- The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
- The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
- The Convention on the Rights of the Child
- The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

These treaties and conventions establish specific rights and obligations for states and other actors, and are often used as a basis for legal challenges to human rights violations.

## Conclusion

International human rights law plays a critical role in promoting and protecting human rights around the world. While there is still much work to be done to ensure that these rights are fully respected and protected, the legal framework established by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequent treaties and conventions provides an important foundation for this work.
