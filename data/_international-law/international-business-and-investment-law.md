International business and investment law is a complex and ever-evolving area of law that regulates the conduct of businesses that operate across international borders. It is a system of rules, treaties, and agreements designed to facilitate cross-border trade and investments while protecting the rights and interests of investors and host countries. 

## Purpose of International Business and Investment Law

The primary purpose of international business and investment law is to promote economic growth, create employment opportunities, and increase foreign investment by providing a stable and transparent legal framework within which businesses can operate. It aims to remove barriers that hinder cross-border trade, such as tariffs, quotas, and other trade restrictions, and creates an environment in which businesses can confidently invest and trade with each other.

## Components of International Business and Investment Law

International business and investment law encompasses a wide range of legal disciplines, including:

- International trade law
- Intellectual property law
- Corporate law
- Tax law
- Environmental law
- Labor law
- Human rights law

International trade law, in particular, has the most direct impact on the conduct of businesses that engage in cross-border trade. It regulates the movement of goods and services between countries and includes rules on customs procedures, import and export controls, technical regulations, and sanitary and phytosanitary measures.

## Major International Business and Investment Law Agreements

There are several major international business and investment law agreements that have been signed between countries. These agreements provide a legal framework for businesses to operate across borders while protecting the rights and interests of investors and host countries. Some of the most important agreements include:

- The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP): Signed in 2016, the TPP is an agreement between 11 Pacific Rim countries that aimed to reduce tariffs, promote investment, and enhance regulatory coherence.

## Conclusion
