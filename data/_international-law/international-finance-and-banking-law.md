International Finance and Banking Law refers to the legal framework that governs financial and banking transactions across borders. In today's globalized world, finance and banking has become an integral part of the global economy. This has led to the emergence of a complex network of laws and regulations that govern international finance and banking transactions. 

## Importance of International Finance and Banking Law
