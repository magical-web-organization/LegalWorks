Environmental impact assessments (EIA) and environmental review are crucial in ensuring that proposed developments do not harm the environment. These terms refer to regulatory processes that evaluate the potential impact a proposed development or project may have on the environment. 

## What is an Environmental Impact Assessment?

An environmental impact assessment is a process that assesses the impact of a proposed development or project on the environment. This process includes gathering information about the proposed development, determining the potential environmental impacts, evaluating the significance of those impacts, and identifying any possible alternatives. The objective of an EIA is to ensure that potential environmental impacts are taken into consideration and minimized or mitigated in the decision-making process.

## What is Environmental Review?

An environmental review is a process that evaluates the environmental impact of a proposed development or project. Unlike an EIA, an environmental review is not a statutory requirement, but rather a discretionary process used by agencies and stakeholders to inform decision-making. An environmental review may be carried out before, during or after an EIA, and can be used to identify any additional impacts that may have been missed during the EIA process.

## Legal Requirements for Environmental Impact Assessments and Environmental Review

Environmental impact assessments and environmental review are required by law in most countries around the world. In the United States, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for any major federal action that significantly affects the quality of the human environment. Similarly, Canadian federal law requires an environmental assessment (EA) for any proposed projects or developments under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012.

## Procedures and Processes Involved

The procedures and processes involved in environmental impact assessments and environmental review vary depending on the country and specific legislation. Generally, the process includes the following steps:

1. Screening: The proposed project or development is assessed to determine whether an EIA or environmental review is required.
2. Scoping: The scope of the assessment is defined, and stakeholders and environmental resources potentially affected by the project are identified.
3. Assessment: Information is gathered and analyzed to identify and evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the proposed development. Alternatives are also considered.
4. Mitigation: Measures are identified to minimize or mitigate any potential adverse environmental impacts.
5. Reporting: A comprehensive report is prepared and submitted to relevant authorities.
6. Review: The report is reviewed and evaluated by relevant authorities, stakeholders and the public before a decision is made.

## Conclusion

Environmental impact assessments and environmental review are crucial in ensuring that potential environmental impacts are taken into consideration when making decisions about proposed developments or projects. While the specific procedures and processes involved may vary depending on the country and legislation, the objective remains the same â€“ to minimize or mitigate the environmental impact of a proposed development.
