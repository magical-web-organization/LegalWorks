Self-defense is the act of protecting oneself or others from any harm or danger. Under criminal law, the use of force is permitted to defend oneself, others, and property. However, the use of force must meet certain criteria to be considered justifiable. Letâ€™s examine what constitutes self-defense and how it applies to criminal law.

## What is Self-Defense?

Self-defense is a legal principle that permits the use of reasonable force to protect oneself from harm or danger. It is an inherent right that allows individuals to protect themselves without being punished by law. The underlying idea behind self-defense is that a person should not be faulted for protecting themselves in situations that put their safety in jeopardy.

## Criteria for Justifiable Use of Force

The use of force is permissible under the law only if certain requirements are met. These criteria include:

1. Imminent threat: The threat of harm or danger must be present, real and immediate. It means the threat is happening right now or is about to happen, and there is no time to seek help or call the police.
2. Proportionate force: The use of force must be proportionate to the threat of harm. It means the force used should be equivalent to the danger that is being faced.
3. Reasonable belief: The person must have a reasonable belief that the use of force was necessary to protect themselves from harm or danger. The belief should be based on facts and circumstances that an ordinary person would have believed in the same situation.
4. No other option: The person must have exhausted all other reasonable alternatives to protect themselves from harm or danger. It means that using force should be the last resort and not the first option.

## Examples of Justifiable Use of Force

Some examples of situations where the use of force may be justified include:

1. A person attacking you with a knife or gun.
2. A person attempting to break into your home or car.
3. Someone attempting to sexually assault you or someone else.

In all of these scenarios, the use of force may be considered justifiable if it meets the criteria outlined above.

## Conclusion

Self-defense is a fundamental right that allows individuals to protect themselves from harm or danger. However, the use of force must meet certain criteria to be considered justified. It is important to remember that the use of force should be the last resort when all other options have been exhausted. Understanding the principles of self-defense and justifiable use of force can help ensure you protect yourself and others within the boundaries of the law.
