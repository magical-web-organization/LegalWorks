Probate and estate administration can be complex legal processes that occur after a person dies. If you're unfamiliar with these terms, it's important to understand what they mean and how they work so that you can effectively navigate the process. In this article, we'll give you an overview of probate and estate administration, including what each of these terms refers to and how they relate to one another.

## What is Probate?

Probate is the legal process by which a deceased person's estate is administered and distributed to their heirs or beneficiaries. This process is supervised by the court and typically involves the following steps:

- Proving the validity of the deceased person's will (if they had one)
- Identifying and inventorying the deceased person's assets and liabilities
- Paying off any debts owed by the estate
- Distributing the remaining assets to the heirs or beneficiaries named in the will (or according to state law if there is no will)

The goal of probate is to ensure that the deceased person's wishes are carried out and that their creditors are paid off before any assets are distributed to heirs or beneficiaries.

## What is Estate Administration?

Estate administration is a broader term that encompasses all of the administrative tasks that must be completed after a person dies. This can include probate, but it also includes other tasks like:

- Informing government agencies (such as the Social Security Administration) of the person's death
- Closing bank accounts, cancelling credit cards, and taking other steps to protect the deceased person's assets
- Filing final tax returns and paying any taxes owed
- Distributing assets that are not subject to probate (such as life insurance policies or retirement accounts)

The goal of estate administration is to manage the deceased person's affairs and assets in a responsible and efficient manner, so that any debts are paid off and assets are distributed to the appropriate parties as quickly and smoothly as possible.

## How Does Probate Relate to Estate Administration?

Probate is just one part of estate administration. While not all estates will go through the probate process, many will. Even if an estate is not subject to probate, there are still many administrative tasks that must be completed in order to settle the estate. It's important to work closely with an experienced attorney who understands the nuances of probate and estate administration so that you can navigate these processes effectively and avoid potential complications.
