As a pet owner, you consider your furry friend to be part of your family. But what happens to your pet when you're no longer here? Who takes care of them? Luckily, you can include your pets in your estate planning.

## Pet Trusts

A pet trust is a legal arrangement that specifies how your pet will be taken care of after you pass away. You can create a trust that includes instructions for your pet's care, such as their food, medical care, and living arrangements.

When creating a pet trust, you'll need to name a trustee who is responsible for managing the trust and ensuring that your pet's needs are met. You'll also need to name a caregiver who will provide daily care for your pet. It's important to choose someone who is responsible and capable of caring for your pet.

## Funding a Pet Trust

One of the most important aspects of creating a pet trust is funding it. You'll need to identify assets that you want to set aside for your pet's care, such as a certain amount of money, real estate, or other valuable assets.

It's important to work with an experienced estate planning attorney to ensure that your pet trust is properly funded and that your assets are distributed according to your wishes.

## Benefits of Pet Trusts

There are several benefits to creating a pet trust:

* Provides for your pet's care after you pass away
* Ensures that your pet is taken care of by someone you trust
* Provides peace of mind knowing that your pet will be taken care of

## Estate Planning for Pets

In addition to creating a pet trust, there are other ways to include your furry friend in your estate planning. For example, you can:

* Include instructions for your pet's care in your will
* Create a durable power of attorney for pet care
* Identify a standby pet guardian in case you are temporarily unable to care for your pet

It's important to plan ahead and make sure that your pet will be taken care of after you pass away.

## Conclusion

Pets are an important part of our lives, and it's important to make sure that they are taken care of after we're gone. Creating a pet trust or including instructions for your pet's care in your estate planning can provide peace of mind and ensure that your furry friend is well taken care of. Consult with an experienced estate planning attorney to learn more about your options for including your pet in your estate plan.
