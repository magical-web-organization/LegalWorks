Cohabitation is an increasingly common trend among unmarried couples who choose to live together without getting married. While it may seem like a simple decision, cohabitation can have legal implications that couples need to be aware of.

One of the most important things that a couple who decide to cohabit need to consider is entering into a cohabitation agreement. A cohabitation agreement, also known as a living together agreement, is a written agreement between two partners who are living together but are not married. The agreement sets out the rights and obligations of each partner during the course of the relationship and in the event of separation.

## Why do you need a Cohabitation Agreement?

A cohabitation agreement can help protect the rights of individuals who have decided to live together without marriage. Legal disputes can arise between couples who are not married, particularly when they separate, and these disputes can be difficult and costly to resolve. A Living Together Agreement can help to avoid these difficulties.

A cohabitation agreement can cover a range of issues, including property rights, financial support, and the division of property in the event of separation. It can also include provisions for the care of any children of the relationship. The agreement can be tailored to meet the specific needs and circumstances of the couple.

## What can a Cohabitation Agreement cover?

Following are some of the things that can be included in a cohabitation agreement:

### Property Rights

A cohabitation agreement can set out the property rights of each partner. This can include ownership of the family home, as well as other property and assets that are acquired during the relationship.

### Financial Support

The agreement can include provisions for financial support. This can include payment of bills, rent, or mortgage payments, as well as contributions to household expenses.

### Division of Property

The agreement can also set out how property will be divided in the event of separation. This can include the division of the family home, as well as other assets such as cars, furniture, and bank accounts.

### Children

A cohabitation agreement can also include provisions for the care of any children of the relationship. This can include arrangements for custody and visitation, as well as financial support for the children.

## How to create a Cohabitation Agreement?

A cohabitation agreement can be created through the help of legal professionals such as solicitors or lawyers. Both partners should receive independent legal advice from different solicitors to avoid any conflict of interest.

The agreement should be in writing and signed by both partners. It is important that the agreement is created as early as possible in the relationship and that it is reviewed periodically to ensure that it reflects the current circumstances and needs of the couple.

## Conclusion

Cohabitation agreements can be a valuable tool for unmarried couples who choose to live together. By setting out the rights and obligations of each partner, a cohabitation agreement can help prevent legal disputes and make separation less stressful.

If you are considering cohabitation, it is important to seek legal advice and create a cohabitation agreement that reflects your specific needs and circumstances.
