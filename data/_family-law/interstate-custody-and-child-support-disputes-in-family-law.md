## Introduction

Custody and child support disputes are already difficult enough, but it becomes more complicated when the parents reside in different states. This is called an interstate custody and child support dispute. This article will discuss the basics of interstate custody and child support disputes and what you can do if you find yourself in one.

## Jurisdiction

Jurisdiction refers to a court's ability to hear and decide a case. In custody and child support cases, jurisdiction is determined by the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA). According to the UCCJEA, the home state of the child has jurisdiction over custody and child support cases. 

The home state is determined by where the child has lived for at least six consecutive months before the case is filed. If the child is less than six months old, the home state is where the child has lived since birth. 

If there are multiple states involved, the court in the home state has priority over the other states. This means that the court in the home state must make a custody determination first.

## Child Support

Child support orders are enforced across state lines by the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA). Each state has its own child support guidelines, but the state that issued the child support order has continuing jurisdiction over the case. 

If a parent wants to modify a child support order, the case must be filed in the state that issued the original child support order. However, if one parent moves to a different state, they may request a modification in their new state if there is a significant change in circumstances.

## Resolving Interstate Custody and Child Support Disputes

If you find yourself in an interstate custody and child support dispute, it's essential to hire an experienced family law attorney. They can help you navigate the complexities of the UCCJEA and UIFSA and represent you in court.

If you need to modify a custody or child support order, you must file a motion in the court that issued the original order. You should also consult with an attorney in the new state to ensure compliance with local laws.

## Conclusion

Interstate custody and child support disputes require navigating multiple states' laws and may become complicated. If you find yourself in one, it's essential to work with an experienced family law attorney to help you navigate the legal process. Remember, the welfare of your child is always essential, so always act in their best interest.
