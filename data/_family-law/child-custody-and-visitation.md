When a couple with children decides to separate or divorce, one of the most difficult aspects to navigate is custody and visitation arrangements. It is a highly emotional time for both parents and children, often resulting in disputes and disagreements. However, it is important to understand the laws regarding child custody and visitation to protect your custody rights and keep your family together. 

## Types of Custody

In general, there are two types of custody - legal custody and physical custody. 

### Legal Custody 

Legal custody refers to a parent's right to make decisions about the child's upbringing, such as education, medical care, and religious activities. In most cases, parents share legal custody unless it is determined that one parent is unfit to make such decisions. 

### Physical Custody

Physical custody refers to the actual physical care and residence of the child. This can be either joint or sole custody. Joint physical custody means that the child spends significant time with both parents, while sole physical custody means that the child primarily resides with one parent, and the other parent may have visitation rights. 

## Determining Custody 

Custody arrangements can be determined either through an agreement between the parents or through a court order. In either case, the best interests of the child are the primary consideration. 

Factors that may be considered when determining custody arrangements include:

- The child's age and needs
- The parents' ability to provide for the child's needs
- The child's relationship with each parent
- Each parent's involvement in the child's life prior to separation or divorce
- Any history of abuse or neglect

## Visitation 

Even if a parent does not have physical custody of the child, they may still have visitation rights. Visitation allows the non-custodial parent to spend time with the child on a regular basis. 

Visitation schedules can be determined through an agreement between the parents or through a court order. It is important to follow the schedule as ordered to avoid legal complications.

## Modifying Custody and Visitation Orders 

Custody and visitation orders can be modified if there is a significant change in circumstances, such as a parent moving to a new location or a change in the child's needs. However, the change must be significant enough to warrant a modification.

## Conclusion 

Child custody and visitation are complex issues that require careful consideration. It is important to understand the laws regarding custody and visitation to protect your rights and your child's well-being. If you are facing custody or visitation disputes, it is recommended to seek the guidance of a family law attorney to help navigate the legal process.
