## Introduction

When we purchase products, we expect them to be safe and function as intended. However, sometimes products have defects that can cause harm or injury to consumers. When this happens, it falls under product liability law, which holds manufacturers, distributors, and retailers responsible for injuries caused by their products.

## Types of Defects

There are three main types of defects that can make a product unsafe:

### Design Defects

Design defects occur when the product's design is inherently unsafe or flawed. For example, a ladder with a design flaw that causes it to collapse when weight is applied could be considered defective.

### Manufacturing Defects

Manufacturing defects occur during the production process and can cause a product to be unsafe, even if the design is sound. For example, a tire with a weak spot caused by a manufacturing defect could blow out while driving, causing an accident.

### Marketing Defects

Marketing defects occur when a product is marketed or sold in a way that is misleading or fails to provide adequate safety warnings. For example, a medication that does not clearly warn of potential side effects could be considered defective.

## Liability for Defective Products

When a person is injured by a defective product, there are several parties that could be held liable:

### Manufacturer

The manufacturer of a product is responsible for ensuring that the product is safe for its intended use. If a product is defectively designed or contains a manufacturing defect, the manufacturer could be held liable for any resulting injuries.

### Distributor

The distributor of a product is responsible for ensuring that the product is safe when it is distributed to retailers or consumers. If a product is defectively manufactured or contains a marketing defect, the distributor could be held liable for any resulting injuries.

### Retailer

The retailer of a product is responsible for ensuring that the product is safe when it is sold to consumers. If a product is defectively marketed or contains a marketing defect, the retailer could be held liable for any resulting injuries.

## Conclusion

If you have been injured by a defective product, you may be entitled to compensation for your injuries. It is important to speak with an experienced personal injury attorney who can help you determine who is liable for your injuries and hold them accountable. By doing so, you can protect your rights and receive the compensation you deserve.
