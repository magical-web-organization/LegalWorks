## What are Toxic Torts?

Toxic torts refer to injury or illness caused by exposure to dangerous chemicals or substances. These substances could include anything from pesticides and asbestos, to lead paint and industrial waste. If you have suffered physical harm or injury due to exposure to one of these substances, you may have a personal injury case based on toxic tort law.

## What is Chemical Exposure?

Chemical exposure refers to the contact or inhalation of harmful substances or chemicals that can result in injuries, illnesses, or long-term medical conditions. These chemicals can have severe and lasting effects, such as cancer, lung and heart disease, and other chronic conditions.

If you have been exposed to toxic substances or chemicals, you may have a personal injury claim based on toxic tort law.
