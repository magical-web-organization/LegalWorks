## What are Deceptive Business Practices?

Some common examples of deceptive business practices include:

## How to Protect Yourself from Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices

There are several steps you can take to protect yourself from falling victim to consumer fraud and deceptive business practices:

1. Research the company or product before making a purchase. Check online reviews and complaints, and look up the company with the Better Business Bureau.

2. Be wary of unsolicited phone calls or emails. Don't give out personal or financial information to anyone who contacts you out of the blue.

3. Carefully read all terms and conditions before making a purchase. Make note of any hidden fees or charges, and be wary of promises that sound too good to be true.

4. Keep your personal and financial information secure. Use strong passwords and keep your computer and mobile devices up to date with the latest security software.

5. Stay alert for signs of fraud or deceptive practices, such as suspicious charges on your credit card, unexpected bills or invoices, or unsolicited offers for investment opportunities.

By staying informed and taking precautions, you can reduce your risk of becoming a victim of consumer fraud and deceptive business practices. If you do encounter a problem, you can report it to the Federal Trade Commission or your state's attorney general's office for assistance.
