In today’s market, we rely heavily on the products we buy to be safe and meet our expectations. However, sometimes products can cause harm or not function as intended, leading to a consumer’s injury or illness. This is where the laws surrounding product liability and recalls come into play. In this article, we will explain what product liability and recalls are and what you can do to protect yourself as a consumer.

## Product Liability

Product liability refers to the legal responsibility of manufacturers, distributors, and retailers for injuries or damages caused by their products. It is based on the idea that products should be safe when used as intended, and companies have a duty to ensure their products do not cause harm to consumers.

There are three main types of product defects that can lead to liability:

- Design defects: These defects are inherent to the product's design and can cause it to be dangerous or not work as intended even after being manufactured correctly.
- Manufacturing defects: These defects occur during the manufacturing process and can make otherwise safe products dangerous if they deviate from the intended design.
- Marketing defects: These defects are related to the instructions, warnings, or advertising associated with the product. For instance, if a product’s labeling is inadequate to warn of drug side effects, a company may be held liable for injuries resulting from its use.

If you are injured by a defective product, you may be able to file a product liability claim. In this type of lawsuit, you must prove that the product was defective, that it caused your injury, and that the defect was present when it left the manufacturer’s control.

## Recalls

A product recall is a measure taken by a manufacturer or the government to remove a product from the market that is potentially dangerous or defective. Recalls are often initiated after a company or regulatory agency conducts an investigation and finds that a certain product has a defect or hazard.

Recalls can be voluntary or mandatory, and the recall notice will include information on how consumers can obtain refunds or repairs for the recalled product. If you think you have a recalled product in your possession, you should stop using it immediately and follow the instructions in the recall notice.

## What You Can Do

If you have been injured by a defective product or own a recalled product, there are steps you can take to protect yourself:

- Keep the product and all its packaging in your possession, as this can be important evidence in a product liability case.
- Seek medical attention if you have been injured by the product.
- Contact the manufacturer or seller of the product to report the issue and obtain information about any recalls or compensation programs.
- Contact a product liability attorney to discuss your legal options and determine if you have a case.

In conclusion, while we expect the products we buy to be safe and function as intended, sometimes defects can cause injury or illness. By understanding product liability and recalls, you can protect yourself as a consumer and take the appropriate action if necessary.
