As a consumer, purchasing and maintaining a vehicle can be a significant investment. Whether buying a new or used car, there are legal considerations to keep in mind when it comes to automobile sales and repairs. In this guide, we’ll provide an overview of your rights as a customer and what to do if you encounter a problem.

## Buying a Car

When purchasing a car, make sure to do your research and check the vehicle’s history. This includes obtaining a vehicle history report, reviewing any previous accidents or damage, and verifying the car’s maintenance history.

Additionally, be aware of any warranties or guarantees for the vehicle. Some warranties may be provided by the manufacturer or dealership, while others may be purchased separately.

## Lemon Laws

If you purchase a vehicle that turns out to be defective, you may have recourse under the lemon law. Lemon laws vary by state, but generally provide a remedy for customers who have purchased a vehicle that repeatedly fails to meet standards of quality and performance.

If your vehicle qualifies under your state’s lemon law, you may be entitled to a refund, replacement, or repair. Be sure to keep documentation of all repairs and attempts to resolve the issue.

## Auto Repairs

If your vehicle requires repairs, make sure to get a written estimate from the repair shop. The estimate should include the cost of labor and any parts needed for the repair.

Additionally, be aware of any warranties or guarantees for repairs. Some repair shops may provide guarantees for their work, while others may sell warranties separately.

## Consumer Protection

As a customer, you have rights under consumer protection laws. These laws are in place to protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices.

If you believe you have been the victim of unfair or deceptive practices from a car dealership or repair shop, file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or your state’s attorney general’s office.

## Conclusion

Purchasing and maintaining a vehicle is a significant investment. By staying informed of your rights and doing your research, you can protect yourself from potential legal issues related to automobile sales and repairs. If you encounter a problem, contact a legal professional to help guide you through the process.
