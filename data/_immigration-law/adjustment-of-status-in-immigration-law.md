If you are a foreign national seeking to live and work permanently in the United States, you need to apply for an immigrant visa. However, if you already live in the US and meet certain criteria, you can apply for Adjustment of Status (AOS). AOS is the process of becoming a permanent resident of the US while already being present in the country on a nonimmigrant visa.

## Who is eligible for Adjustment of Status?

As a foreign national, you have to meet several criteria to qualify for AOS. Firstly, you must be present in the US on a valid nonimmigrant visa such as a student visa, work visa, or visitor visa. Secondly, you must have an immigrant visa immediately available when you apply for AOS. This is because, with AOS, you are not issued a new visa but instead, you are adjusting your status to that of a permanent resident.

Additionally, you must be otherwise admissible to the US as an immigrant, meaning you meet all the criteria for admission to the US, such as not having committed any crimes, not having any serious health issues and not violating any US laws.

## How to apply for Adjustment of Status

To apply for AOS, you need to file Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence with the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Alternatively, you can apply for AOS at the consulate abroad if you have not yet entered the US on a nonimmigrant visa.

Along with the form, you'll need to submit several supporting documents, such as proof of legal entry into the US, a medical examination report, police clearance certificates from countries where you've lived for more than six months, and photos. You'll also need to pay the applicable fees to USCIS.

After reviewing your application and supporting documents, USCIS may request additional information or schedule an interview. If they approve your application, you'll receive your permanent resident status, also known as your "green card." However, if your application is denied, you can appeal the decision or reapply if you are eligible to do so.

## Conclusion

Adjustment of Status is an essential process for foreign nationals who wish to become permanent residents of the US while already present in the country on a nonimmigrant visa. As with any immigration process, it is crucial to consult an experienced immigration lawyer to ensure that you meet all the requirements and have the best chance of success.
