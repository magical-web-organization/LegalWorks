When an individual is deemed inadmissible to the United States due to previous criminal records, immigration violations, or other reasons, they can apply for a waiver of inadmissibility. A waiver offers individuals the opportunity to overcome their inadmissibility and obtain lawful status in the country.

## Who is Eligible for a Waiver of Inadmissibility?

Not all inadmissibility grounds can be waived, and not all applicants are eligible to apply for waivers. The eligibility to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility depends on the specific ground(s) of inadmissibility the individual falls under.

Common grounds of inadmissibility where waivers are available include:

## Unlawful Presence
Individuals who overstayed their visas, or entered the United States without inspection or admission, accrue unlawful presence. Individuals who have accrued more than 180 days of unlawful presence are subject to a three-year bar upon departure from the United States. Individuals who have accrued more than one year of unlawful presence are subject to a ten-year bar. In such cases, individuals can apply for a waiver of inadmissibility to overcome these bars.

## Criminal Convictions
Individuals with criminal convictions, drug offenses, or multiple convictions, may be inadmissible to the United States. However, a waiver of inadmissibility may be available to individuals who can demonstrate that being barred from the United States would result in extreme hardship to their U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse, parent or child.

## Fraud and Misrepresentation 
Individuals who have made false statements, committed fraud, or willfully misrepresented information on their visa application or during the visa application process may also be inadmissible. In some cases, a waiver may be available if it is demonstrated that denying the waiver would result in extreme hardship to the applicantâ€™s qualifying family member.

## The Process of Obtaining a Waiver of Inadmissibility
Applying for a waiver of inadmissibility is a complex and lengthy process that may require several steps. The applicant must first file the appropriate waiver application with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). In some cases, the applicant may need to appear for an interview with an immigration officer. It is important to note that USCIS has the discretion to grant or deny a waiver application.

## Conclusion
Waivers of inadmissibility can offer individuals a second chance to obtain lawful status in the United States. However, not all grounds of inadmissibility can be waived, and not everyone may be eligible for a waiver. If you or someone you know is facing inadmissibility grounds, it is important to consult with an experienced immigration attorney who can advise on the best immigration strategy.
