As an undocumented immigrant, living in the United States can be challenging, especially when it comes to issues concerning work, education, or deportation. Fortunately, there's a program that provides temporary legal relief, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA. In this article, we'll delve into DACA and how it impacts immigration law in the United States.

## What is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)?

DACA is a program established on June 15, 2012, by President Barack Obama, through an executive order. It provides a temporary shield from deportation, renewable every two years, for undocumented immigrants brought unlawfully to the United States as children, also called Dreamers. In addition, DACA recipients can obtain a driver's license, social security number, and work authorization.

## DACA Eligibility Criteria

To qualify for DACA, you must meet the following requirements:

* Have arrived in the United States before the age of 16 years old.
* Have lived in the United States for at least five years before June 15, 2012.
* Are currently studying, obtained a high school diploma, or a GED.
* Have no criminal record or pose a national security threat.

## Current Status of DACA Program

On September 5, 2017, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump Administration would end DACA. The decision to rescind the program was based on the belief that DACA was unconstitutional because it was established through an executive order, instead of being approved by Congress. Furthermore, the Trump administration argued that the program contributed to illegal immigration, drain on the country's resources, and lack of respect for the rule of law.

The decision to end DACA was challenged and has since been litigated in the courts. Several lawsuits were filed to prevent the rescission of the program, arguing that the decision was arbitrary and capricious. In June 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration failed to follow the appropriate procedures for ending the program. As a result, the program has been allowed to continue, and new applications are being accepted.

## Benefits of DACA

Since its inception, DACA has changed the lives of over 800,000 individuals in the United States. Some benefits of DACA include:

* Protection from deportation or removal from the country.
* Opportunity to obtain work authorization, obtain a social security number, and driver's license.
* Access to higher education through in-state tuition and financial aid programs.
* Ability to provide financial support to their families and contribute to the U.S. economy.

## Legal Advice for DACA Application

If you meet the eligibility criteria for DACA, it's crucial to retain the services of an experienced immigration attorney to help you with your application. Your attorney can help you gather the necessary documentation, fill out the application accurately, and work with the USCIS to ensure the application's success. Additionally, if you're facing deportation proceedings or have been removed from the country, your attorney can help you pursue legal options to protect your rights.

## Conclusion

Overall, DACA has provided much-needed relief to undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. However, the program has faced significant challenges in recent years, and its future is uncertain. If you're a Dreamer or know someone who meets the eligibility criteria for DACA, seek legal guidance from an experienced immigration attorney to protect your legal rights and options.
