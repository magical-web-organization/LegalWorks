Immigrants who are facing criminal charges should be aware of the potential consequences of those charges on their immigration status. Even a minor criminal conviction can result in serious consequences, including deportation or denial of legal status.

Here are some of the criminal immigration consequences that immigrants may face:

## Inadmissibility

If an immigrant is deemed to be "inadmissible" by U.S. immigration authorities, they will not be allowed to enter or remain in the United States. Inadmissibility can be triggered by a variety of factors, including a criminal conviction.

## Deportation

If an immigrant is convicted of certain crimes, they may be deported from the United States. Crimes that can result in deportation include crimes involving moral turpitude, aggravated felonies, and drug offenses.

## Denial of Naturalization

Immigrants who are seeking U.S. citizenship may be denied naturalization if they have a criminal record. Even minor offenses can be enough to prevent an immigrant from becoming a citizen.

## Temporary Protected Status (TPS)

Immigrants who have been granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) may lose that status if they are convicted of certain crimes. This can result in the loss of legal status and the possibility of deportation.

## Avoiding Criminal Immigration Consequences

Immigrants who are facing criminal charges should work with an experienced immigration attorney as soon as possible to understand the potential immigration consequences of their charges. Some of the steps that an attorney may recommend include:

- Negotiating a plea bargain that avoids the most serious criminal charges and minimizes the immigration consequences of a conviction
- Pursuing post-conviction relief, including appeals, to vacate or reduce a criminal conviction
- Seeking a waiver or other relief to overcome the immigration consequences of a criminal conviction

By taking proactive steps and working with an experienced attorney, immigrants can help minimize the potential immigration consequences of criminal charges.

## Conclusion

Criminal charges can have serious consequences on an immigrant's ability to remain in the United States. Immigrants who are facing criminal charges should seek the advice of an experienced immigration attorney to understand their options and potential consequences. By taking proactive steps and working with an attorney, immigrants may be able to minimize the negative impacts of criminal charges on their immigration status.
