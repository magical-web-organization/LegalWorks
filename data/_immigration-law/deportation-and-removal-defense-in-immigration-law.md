Immigration law is a complex field that deals with many different legal issues, one of which is the deportation and removal of non-citizens from the United States. Deportation, also known as removal, is the process of forcing an immigrant to leave the country due to violations of immigration law or other issues. If you or someone you know is facing deportation or removal, it is important to understand the reasons for removal, types of defenses available, and how to get legal help.

## Reasons for Deportation

There are many different reasons why a non-citizen may face deportation or removal from the United States, including:

- Entering the country illegally or without proper documentation
- Violating the terms of their visa or overstaying their visa
- Committing a crime, including offenses that are considered “crimes of moral turpitude,” such as fraud or theft, or “aggravated felonies” such as drug trafficking or murder
- Engaging in activities that are considered a threat to national security, such as terrorism or espionage
- Failing to comply with immigration laws or orders to leave the country

These are just a few of the reasons why a non-citizen may be subject to deportation or removal. If you are facing removal, it is important to understand the specific reason why you are being targeted.

## Types of Defenses

If you or someone you know is facing deportation or removal, there are several different types of defenses that may be available. Some of the most common defenses include:

- Adjustment of status – This is a process that allows certain immigrants to apply for permanent residency in the United States, even if they are facing removal.
- Cancellation of removal – This is a defense that may be available to non-citizens who have been physically present in the United States for a certain period of time and can demonstrate that their removal would cause extreme hardship to themselves or their family.
- Asylum – This is a defense that may be available to immigrants who can demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country based on their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.
- Waivers – There are several different types of waivers that may be available to non-citizens who are facing removal, including waivers for unlawful presence or fraud.
- Prosecutorial discretion – This is a defense that involves convincing the government not to pursue deportation or removal in a particular case.

These are just a few examples of the defenses that may be available to non-citizens who are facing deportation or removal. It is important to consult with an experienced immigration attorney who can evaluate your case and determine the best course of action.
