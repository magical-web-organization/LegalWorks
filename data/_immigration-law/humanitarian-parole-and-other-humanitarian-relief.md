As a nation founded by immigrants, the United States has long been a beacon of hope for individuals fleeing persecution, war, and other dire circumstances. Over the years, the US government has developed various forms of humanitarian relief to assist those in need.

## What is Humanitarian Parole?

Humanitarian parole is a temporary immigration status that allows an individual to enter the US on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or for a significant public benefit. Generally, humanitarian parole is not intended to be a substitute for other immigration categories or for refugees.

Humanitarian parole may be granted if an individual has a compelling emergency, such as a medical condition that requires urgent care in the US or the need to attend a family member's funeral. Additionally, humanitarian parole may be granted in certain situations where there is a significant public benefit, such as to allow a person to testify in a high-profile court case.

It is essential to note that humanitarian parole is granted on a discretionary basis and is not a guaranteed form of relief. Therefore, it is crucial to have an experienced immigration attorney guide you through the application process.

## Asylum

Asylum is another form of humanitarian relief available to people who are unable or unwilling to return to their home country because of fear of persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. To be eligible for asylum, an individual must apply for it within one year of arriving in the US.

Individuals granted asylum will be allowed to stay and work in the US for as long as they need protection. After one year, asylees may apply for permanent residency (green card).

## Temporary Protected Status (TPS)

Temporary Protected Status (TPS) is a temporary immigration status that provides protection to individuals from designated countries who are unable to return safely to their home country due to ongoing armed conflict, an environmental disaster, or other extraordinary and temporary conditions.

Individuals granted TPS may apply for work permits and travel authorization. While TPS does not lead to permanent residency or citizenship, it does afford temporary protection against deportation.

## Conclusion

Applying for humanitarian relief is not a straightforward process, and successful applications often depend on a broad range of factors. If you are considering humanitarian parole, asylum, or TPS, it is crucial to have a knowledgeable and experienced immigration attorney guide you through the process.
