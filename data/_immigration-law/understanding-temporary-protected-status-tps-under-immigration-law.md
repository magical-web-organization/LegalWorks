Temporary Protected Status (TPS) is a program created by the United States government to protect foreign nationals who are unable to return to their home countries due to ongoing armed conflict, environmental disasters, or other extraordinary conditions. TPS provides temporary legal status and work authorization to eligible individuals, allowing them to remain in the United States until conditions in their home countries improve.

## Eligibility for TPS

To be eligible for TPS, an individual must meet the following requirements:

- Be a national of a country designated for TPS by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
- Be physically present in the United States on the date of the TPS designation or the effective date of an extension of a TPS designation
- Meet certain continuous residence and continuous physical presence requirements
- Pass background checks and not have any felony convictions or more than one misdemeanor conviction
- Register for TPS during the initial registration period or re-registration period

If an individual meets these eligibility requirements, they may be granted TPS for an initial period of six to 18 months, depending on the conditions in their home country. TPS can be extended if the conditions in the country continue to warrant it.

## Benefits of TPS

Individuals granted TPS are protected from deportation and can obtain work authorization. They may also be eligible for advance parole, which allows them to travel outside the United States and return without losing their TPS status.

## Current Updates on TPS

The current administration in the United States has made changes to the TPS program, with some countries' designations for TPS being terminated or extended for shorter periods of time than previously granted. As of August 2021, countries with TPS designations include El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

It is important for individuals with TPS to stay up to date on any changes to the program that may affect their eligibility or status. Consulting with an experienced immigration attorney can provide guidance and support throughout the TPS process.

## Conclusion

Temporary Protected Status is a valuable program that provides temporary legal status and work authorization to eligible foreign nationals who are unable to return to their home countries due to extraordinary conditions. Meeting the eligibility requirements and staying up to date on the current state of the TPS program is crucial for those seeking this protection. Consider seeking legal advice from a qualified immigration attorney for further assistance in navigating the process.
