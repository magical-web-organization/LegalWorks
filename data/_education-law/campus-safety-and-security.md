When parents send their children off to college, they expect them to be safe and secure on campus. Educational institutions have a legal obligation to provide a safe and secure environment for their students, faculty, and staff. While no one can guarantee complete safety, there are several best practices that colleges and universities can follow to help ensure a safe and secure campus.

## Legal Obligations

Under federal law, colleges and universities must comply with the Clery Act, which requires them to annually disclose information about crimes on and near their campuses. This information must be made available to the public, and includes statistics on the number and type of crimes that occurred, as well as policies and procedures related to campus safety and security.

In addition to the Clery Act, institutions may be subject to other federal and state laws related to campus safety and security. For example, Title IX requires institutions to address sexual harassment and violence, and the Americans with Disabilities Act requires institutions to ensure that individuals with disabilities have equal access to campus facilities.

## Best Practices

Colleges and universities can take several steps to promote campus safety and security, including:

1. Developing and implementing a comprehensive campus safety and security plan that includes policies and procedures for emergency situations, such as active shooter scenarios.

2. Providing regular training for students, faculty, and staff on how to respond to emergency situations.

3. Installing security cameras, lighting, and access control systems to monitor and limit access to campus buildings and grounds.

4. Providing campus escorts and shuttle services to enhance safety during evening hours.

5. Conducting background checks on employees and contractors who work on campus.

6. Creating a campus-wide reporting system for incidents of crime or other safety concerns.

7. Developing partnerships with local law enforcement and emergency response agencies.

## Conclusion

Protecting the safety and security of students, faculty, and staff is a top priority for educational institutions. By complying with federal and state laws related to campus safety and security, and implementing best practices such as those listed above, colleges and universities can help ensure a safe and secure campus environment.
