When it comes to running a business or running a payroll, it is important to be aware of any tax obligations that come along with it. Employment taxes and payroll taxes can be tricky to navigate, but it is important to stay on top of these tax issues to avoid potential legal problems. In this article, we will discuss employment tax and payroll tax issues that employers need to be aware of in tax law.

## What is Employment Tax?

Employment taxes are taxes that must be paid by employers based on their employees' wages, tips, and other forms of compensation. These taxes are paid to the federal government, state government, and sometimes to local governments. The following are the main types of employment taxes:

- Social Security and Medicare taxes: Also referred to as Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes, employers are required to withhold these taxes from their employees' paychecks. Employers must also match employees' Social Security and Medicare taxes (up to a certain amount) and pay the amount they owe to the federal government.

- Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) taxes: This tax is paid by employers to provide unemployment benefits to workers who lose their jobs. Employers pay FUTA taxes and also file a Form 940 to report their FUTA tax liability.

- State Unemployment Tax Act (SUTA) taxes: Similar to FUTA taxes, this tax is paid by employers to cover unemployment benefits. Employers must pay SUTA taxes and file a Form 941 to report their SUTA tax liability.

## What is Payroll Tax?

Payroll taxes are another type of tax that employers must pay to the federal government. These taxes are paid on behalf of employees and are calculated based on their gross pay. The following are the main types of payroll taxes:

- Federal income tax: Employers are required to withhold federal income tax from their employees' paychecks based on their tax withholding status.

- State income tax: Like federal income tax, employers must withhold state income tax from their employees' paychecks. Not all states have state income tax, but those that do require it to be withheld.

- Local income tax: Some localities, like cities or counties, may require income tax to be withheld from employees' paychecks.

- Other payroll taxes: These include taxes like the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes, which include Social Security and Medicare taxes, and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) taxes.

## What are Some Common Employment Tax and Payroll Tax Issues?

Employment tax and payroll tax issues can arise for various reasons. However, some of the most common issues include:

- Late payment or failure to pay: Failure to make timely tax payments or not paying the correct amount of taxes can result in penalties and interest charges.

- Employee misclassification: Misclassifying employees as independent contractors can lead to issues with payroll taxes, as independent contractors are responsible for paying their own self-employment taxes.

- Incorrect reporting: Filing the wrong Forms, reporting incorrect numbers or amounts, or failing to report certain payroll taxes can result in penalties.

- Employee benefit plans: Employee benefit plans such as 401(k) plans, health insurance, or cafeteria plans can impact payroll taxes and must be handled correctly to comply with tax laws.

## Conclusion

In summary, employment tax and payroll tax issues are important topics employers need to be aware of to avoid penalties, legal problems, and headaches. Employers must comply with various federal, state, and local tax regulations, and keeping accurate records of payroll taxes is essential. If you are an employer and need guidance on employment or payroll tax issues, consult with a qualified tax advisor or attorney to help you stay compliant with tax laws.
