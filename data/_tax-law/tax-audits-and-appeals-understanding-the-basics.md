## Overview
A tax audit is a process of verifying that taxpayers have reported and paid their taxes accurately. It is an official examination of an individual’s or a company’s tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other taxing authorities. If the audit concludes that an individual or business owes more taxes than they’ve reported, they will be expected to pay the additional taxes, penalties, and interest.

In such cases, taxpayers who believe that the auditor’s decision or interpretation is incorrect have the option to appeal the result.

Here, we will discuss the basics of tax audits and appeals and how to navigate these processes efficiently.

## Types of Audits
There are three types of tax audits: 

### Correspondence Audit
This type of audit is the least severe and happens when the IRS sends a letter to the taxpayer requesting additional documentation.

### Field Audit
In a field audit, an IRS agent will visit an individual or a business on their premises to thoroughly inspect their financial records.

### Office Audit
An office audit is conducted at the IRS office where the taxpayer brings their financial records for inspection.

## Appealing an Audit Decision
If a taxpayer disagrees with the tax auditor’s decision, they can appeal the decision. However, an appeal must be done correctly and within the timeframe. 

### Filing a Protest Letter
The first step towards appealing an audit decision is filing a protest letter. This letter must include the following details:

- Taxpayer’s name
- Social Security number or TIN
- Contact details
- Notice CP 2000 (examination report) or letter the taxpayer received from the IRS concerning the audit
- The tax year(s) in question
- A detailed explanation of why the taxpayer disagrees with the audit decision
- Facts and evidence supporting the argument

### Reconsideration by the IRS
If the IRS agrees with the taxpayer’s argument in the protest letter, it will reconsider the audit decision. In some cases, a taxpayer may receive a revised audit report.

### Independent Appeals
If the taxpayer disagrees with the revised audit report or the IRS decision, they can request a hearing before an independent administrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ acts as a neutral third party, hearing the taxpayer’s appeal and making a final determination. 

Note that once the ALJ makes a final determination, the taxpayer has the option to either accept it or appeal the decision further in court.
