## Introduction

Bankruptcy can provide much-needed relief to struggling borrowers by wiping out their debts or providing a repayment plan. However, student loans have long been considered one of the most difficult debts to discharge in bankruptcy. In this article, weâ€™ll take a closer look at the impact of bankruptcy on student loans and the options available to borrowers.

## Can You Discharge Student Loans in Bankruptcy?

Student loans are generally not dischargeable in bankruptcy, meaning they cannot be wiped out like credit card debt or medical bills. There are some exceptions to this rule, but they are very limited. To discharge student loans, you must prove that paying them would cause you undue hardship, a standard that is notoriously difficult to meet.

## What is Undue Hardship?

To discharge student loans on the basis of undue hardship, you must typically show all of the following:

- You cannot maintain a minimal standard of living if you are forced to repay the loans.
- Your financial situation is unlikely to improve during the repayment period.
- You have made a good faith effort to repay the loans.

Courts have interpreted this standard differently over the years, but most take a very strict approach. For example, some courts require borrowers to show that they are physically unable to work due to a disability, while others require proof that the borrower has explored all other options, such as income-driven repayment plans.

## Should You Try to Discharge Student Loans in Bankruptcy?

For most borrowers, trying to discharge student loans in bankruptcy is not worth the effort. First, as noted above, the standard for discharging student loans is very high, meaning few borrowers will qualify. Second, even if you do qualify, the process can be time-consuming, expensive, and emotionally draining. Finally, discharging student loans in bankruptcy may have long-term consequences, such as damage to your credit score and difficulty securing credit in the future.

## What Other Options Are Available?

Although you cannot discharge student loans in bankruptcy, you still have other options for managing them. For example, you may be able to:

- Consolidate your loans: This can simplify your repayment process by combining multiple loans into a single, more manageable loan with a fixed interest rate.
- Refinance your loans: This involves taking out a new loan with a private lender to pay off your existing student loans. It may lower your interest rate or monthly payments, but it comes with risks, such as losing access to federal loan benefits.
- Apply for an income-driven repayment plan: This can make your monthly payments more affordable by basing them on your income and family size rather than your loan balance.
- Seek loan forgiveness: This may be available if you work in a public service job, such as teaching or nursing, for a certain number of years.

## Conclusion

While bankruptcy may provide relief for many types of debt, it is generally not a viable option for discharging student loans. If you are struggling with student loan debt, you should explore other options, such as consolidation, refinancing, or income-driven repayment plans. If you are considering bankruptcy, be sure to consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to fully understand your options and their potential consequences.
