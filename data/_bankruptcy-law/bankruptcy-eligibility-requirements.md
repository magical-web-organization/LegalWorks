Filing for bankruptcy is a serious financial decision that has long-term implications for your credit score and your future. It provides debtors with an opportunity for financial relief, but eligibility for bankruptcy is not automatic. Bankruptcy laws in the United States have specific eligibility requirements that individuals and companies must meet before filing for bankruptcy. In this article, we will discuss bankruptcy and the eligibility requirements for filing for bankruptcy in the United States.

## Different Types of Bankruptcy

Before discussing the eligibility requirements, it is essential to understand the different types of bankruptcies available. There are two primary types of bankruptcies: Chapter 7 and Chapter 13.

- Chapter 7 bankruptcy is known as liquidation bankruptcy because it involves the liquidation of any non-exempt assets to pay off creditors. This type of bankruptcy typically takes a few months to complete.

- Chapter 13 bankruptcy, also known as reorganization bankruptcy, is a court-supervised payment plan that typically lasts three to five years. Debtors who file for Chapter 13 pay a portion of their debt back to their creditors over the payment plan period.

Once you determine which type of bankruptcy is right for you, you must determine your eligibility.

## Bankruptcy Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for bankruptcy, you must fulfill the following requirements.

### Chapter 7 bankruptcy eligibility requirements:

- Your income must be below the median income level for your state. If your income is more than your state's median income, you must complete an additional portion of the means test to see if you qualify.
- You must not have had a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in the last eight years, or a Chapter 13 discharge in the last six years.
