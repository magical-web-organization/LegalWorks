Bankruptcy can be an effective solution for those struggling with overwhelming debt, but how does bankruptcy impact tax debts? Here we will explore the relationship between bankruptcy and tax debts, including whether tax debts can be discharged in bankruptcy and what options are available for those struggling with tax debt.

## Can Tax Debts be Discharged in Bankruptcy?

While most debts can be discharged in bankruptcy, tax debts are not always eligible for discharge. Generally, only income tax debts can be discharged in bankruptcy, and even then, there are several conditions that must be met. 

Firstly, the tax debt must be at least 3 years old. The IRS typically has 3 years from the date a tax return is due to assess and collect taxes owed. If the tax debt is within this 3-year period, it will not be dischargeable in bankruptcy.

Secondly, the taxpayer must have filed a tax return for the debt at least two years prior to filing for bankruptcy. If the taxpayer has not filed a tax return, the tax debt cannot be discharged.

Finally, the IRS must have assessed the tax debt at least 240 days prior to filing for bankruptcy. If the IRS is still in the process of assessing the tax debt, it cannot be discharged.

## What Happens to Tax Debts in Chapter 7 Bankruptcy?

In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, eligible income tax debts can be discharged just like any other eligible debt. However, there are some circumstances where a tax debt may not be discharged.

For example, if the taxpayer committed fraud or willfully evaded taxes, the tax debt will not be eligible for discharge. Additionally, if the tax debt is due to withholding or trust fund taxes, it cannot be discharged in Chapter 7.

## What Happens to Tax Debts in Chapter 13 Bankruptcy?

In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the debtor proposes a repayment plan to the court that typically lasts between 3 to 5 years. Tax debts can be included in the repayment plan, but they must be paid in full during the course of the plan. 

Under certain circumstances, an individual in Chapter 13 bankruptcy may be entitled to a “hardship discharge” if they are unable to complete the repayment plan due to circumstances beyond their control. This discharge may include discharge of tax debts that were not paid in full during the plan.

## Other Options for Dealing with Tax Debt

If tax debts cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, there are other options available for dealing with tax debt. The IRS offers various payment plans, such as installment agreements or an offer in compromise, which can allow individuals to pay off their tax debts over time.

It is important to speak with a bankruptcy attorney and tax professional to explore all available options for dealing with tax debt. A bankruptcy attorney can provide legal advice on whether bankruptcy may be an appropriate solution for your individual circumstances.

## Conclusion

Bankruptcy can be an effective solution for those struggling with overwhelming debt, but it is important to understand how it impacts tax debts. With the right legal advice and guidance, individuals can navigate their options and find a path towards financial stability. Contact a bankruptcy attorney today to learn more.
