Buying a home is a crucial investment which people take to start a new phase in their lives. However, the possibility of losing that home to foreclosure isn't unheard of. Sometimes, it can give psychological trauma and financial burden to a homeowner. If you're struggling to keep up with your mortgage payments, explore your bankruptcy options to protect your home through foreclosure defense.

## The Relationship between Bankruptcy and Foreclosure Defense

When you file for bankruptcy, the automatic stay is activated. The automatic stay is a court order that immediately stops all attempts to collect any money or property from a debtor. This order is useful for homeowners who are behind on their mortgage payments and facing the possibility of foreclosure. Bankruptcy filing cancels out the automatic stay, putting a temporary hold on the foreclosure process.

## Bankruptcy Options

### Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

Chapter 13 Bankruptcy is an option for homeowners who want to maintain their possession of the property. This form of bankruptcy allows one to consolidate debts into a fixed payment, giving debtors the ability to make their mortgage payments. A Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan should outline how you plan to pay off your mortgage debt while keeping up with regular monthly payments for other debts like car loans or credit cards.

### Chapter 7 Bankruptcy

Chapter 7 Bankruptcy could be a good option if you do not have a regular income or your home is simply too expensive to keep. Chapter 7 bankruptcy is a liquidation process, which means that some property may be sold to pay off owed debts. Filing for chapter 7 bankruptcy could potentially stall the late mortgage payments, but you risk losing your home in the process. In some states, homestead exemptions can offer foreclosure protection.

## How Bankruptcy Helps Homeowners

Bankruptcy can help homeowners stop foreclosure proceedings and give relief from creditor harassment. The automatic stay immediately halts foreclosure proceedings, giving homeowners temporary relief from foreclosure. During a bankruptcy proceeding, homeowners have some legal avenues to explore to keep the possession of their home. Bankruptcy filing also offers homeowners better loan modification options.

## Final Thoughts

Facing foreclosure is a stressful situation that can happen to anyone. If you are falling behind on your mortgage payments, bankruptcy options may provide foreclosure defense to help protect your home. Consult with a bankruptcy attorney to assess which bankruptcy options might be more suitable for your situation. Remember, bankruptcies can ultimately help you keep your home and take control of your finances.
