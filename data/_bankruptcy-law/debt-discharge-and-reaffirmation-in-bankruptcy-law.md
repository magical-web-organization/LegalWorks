Bankruptcy is a legal process that can help individuals and businesses get relief from overwhelming debt. One of the most important concepts in bankruptcy law is debt discharge and reaffirmation. In this article, we will discuss what debt discharge and reaffirmation mean in bankruptcy law, their differences between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and the benefits and risks of reaffirmation.

## What is Debt Discharge?

Debt discharge is a legal process where a debtor is completely released from the obligation to pay certain debts. After filing for bankruptcy, eligible debts are discharged and creditors are not allowed to pursue the debtor for the remaining balance. Most unsecured debts such as credit card debts, medical bills, and personal loans can be discharged in bankruptcy.

Debt discharge is the main goal of Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the debtor’s non-exempt assets are sold to pay off creditors, and the remaining eligible debts are discharged. However, some debts are not eligible for discharge, such as student loans, taxes, child support, and alimony.

## What is Reaffirmation?

Reaffirmation is a legal process where a debtor agrees to continue to pay a debt that would otherwise be discharged in bankruptcy. In other words, the debtor agrees to “reaffirm” the debt as if the bankruptcy never happened. Reaffirming a debt means that the debtor will continue to make payments as agreed before the bankruptcy, and the creditor can pursue the debtor if they fail to make payments.

Reaffirmation is a common option in Chapter 7 bankruptcy for secured debts such as mortgages and car loans. If the debtor wants to keep the secured property, they can reaffirm the debt and keep making payments as if the bankruptcy never happened. However, reaffirmation is not automatic, and the debtor must sign a reaffirmation agreement with the creditor and file it with the bankruptcy court.

Reaffirmation is also an option in Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which is a reorganization plan that allows the debtor to keep their property while repaying all or a portion of their debts over a period of 3 to 5 years. In Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the debtor can reaffirm secured debts and include them in the repayment plan. Reaffirming a debt in Chapter 13 bankruptcy means that the debtor will continue to make payments as agreed before the bankruptcy, and the creditor is bound by the repayment plan.

## Benefits and Risks of Reaffirmation

Reaffirmation can have both benefits and risks for the debtor. The main benefit of reaffirmation is that the debtor can keep the secured property such as a house or a car. Reaffirmation may also help the debtor improve their credit score by showing that they are capable of paying their debts as agreed.

However, reaffirmation also comes with risks. By reaffirming a debt, the debtor is agreeing to continue paying the debt even if they experience financial difficulties in the future. If the debtor fails to make payments, the creditor can repossess the property and pursue the debtor for deficiency judgments.

Reaffirmation also means that the debtor cannot discharge the debt in a future bankruptcy, as the debt has been excluded from the bankruptcy filing. This means that if the debtor continues to struggle with payments, they may be unable to file for bankruptcy protection in the future, leaving them in a more difficult financial position.

In conclusion, debt discharge and reaffirmation are crucial concepts in bankruptcy law. Debt discharge is the main goal of Chapter 7 bankruptcy, while reaffirmation allows debtors to keep secured property by agreeing to continue paying the debt. Reaffirmation comes with both benefits and risks, and debtors should carefully consider their options before signing a reaffirmation agreement.
