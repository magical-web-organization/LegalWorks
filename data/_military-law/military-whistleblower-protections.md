Whistleblowers play a crucial role in upholding the law and exposing wrongdoing within the military. However, blowing the whistle on illegal activities can also result in retaliation from superiors, including demotion, harassment, and even termination. To address this issue, the U.S. government has enacted laws that protect military whistleblowers from retaliation. In this article, weâ€™ll discuss the protections available to military whistleblowers and the steps they can take to file a complaint.

## Whistleblower Protection Act

The Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) is a federal law that protects government employees, including military personnel, from retaliation when they disclose information about illegal activities or violations of laws, regulations, or policies. The WPA covers disclosures made to Congress, Inspectors General, or other designated agencies, as well as to supervisors or co-workers who have the authority to investigate or correct the wrongdoing.

Under the WPA, military whistleblowers who believe they have been subjected to retaliation can file a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), an independent federal agency that investigates claims of retaliation. The OSC has the authority to seek corrective action, including reinstatement, back pay, and attorney fees, on behalf of whistleblowers who have been wronged.

## Military Whistleblower Protection Act

In addition to the WPA, the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (MWPA) provides specific protections for military members who report violations of law or regulations, gross mismanagement, abuse of authority, or substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. The law requires military officials to investigate and take appropriate action in response to such reports, and prohibits retaliation against the whistleblower.

Under the MWPA, military whistleblowers have the right to file a complaint with their commanding officer, the Inspector General of their service branch, or the Department of Defense (DOD) Inspector General. If the whistleblower believes that the response of the military authorities is inadequate, the whistleblower can file a complaint with the OSC or a DOD Hotline.

## Steps to Take When Filing a Complaint

If you are a military whistleblower who has suffered retaliation for reporting illegal activities or violations of law, here are the steps you should take to file a complaint:

1. Make sure you have a written copy of your report or disclosure, and any evidence that supports your claim of retaliation.
2. Determine the appropriate agency to file a complaint with based on the type of disclosure you made and the nature of the retaliation you faced.
3. Gather any additional evidence or witness testimony that supports your claim of retaliation.
4. File a complaint with the appropriate agency within the time frame required by law.
5. Work with an attorney or legal advisor throughout the process to ensure that your rights are protected and that you receive the remedies you are entitled to.

## Conclusion

Military whistleblowers play an essential role in holding the military accountable for its actions and upholding the rule of law. However, whistleblowers can face retaliation from superiors who want to keep the wrongdoing hidden. Fortunately, there are laws in place to protect whistleblowers from retaliation and ensure that they can report wrongdoing without fear of retribution. If you are a military whistleblower who has experienced retaliation, it is important to know your rights and take action to protect them. With the right steps, you can hold wrongdoers accountable and help ensure that the military is accountable to the law and to the American people.
