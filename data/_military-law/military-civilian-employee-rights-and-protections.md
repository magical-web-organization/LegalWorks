When it comes to serving in the military, one might assume that only those in uniform have rights and protections under the law. However, this is not the case as even the military civilian employees are provided with certain protections and legal rights under both federal and state law. In this article, we will discuss some of the most important rights and protections afforded to military civilian employees.

## Protecting against discrimination and harassment 

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces federal laws that prohibit certain forms of discrimination against military civilian employees. It is illegal to discriminate against an employee, current or former, because of their military service, indicating an intent to serve, or related medical conditions. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) protects against discrimination based on past, current, or future military service, and provides reemployment rights after military leave.

Furthermore, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides protection against discrimination based on characteristics like gender, race, religion, national origin, or sex. This means that military civilian employees who face any type of discrimination, retaliation, or harassment are entitled to file a complaint with the EEOC or pursue legal action in court.

## Addressing pay and benefits issues

Most military civilian employees are entitled to certain pay and benefits, such as paid time off, health and life insurance, retirement benefits, and other employment benefits. The laws governing military civilian employee pay and benefits are complex, but there are important protections in place that must be followed.

For example, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) sets forth minimum wage and overtime pay provisions, which apply to military civilian employees in the same way as they do to all other civilian employees. Moreover, under the federal Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), military civilian employees are eligible to receive retirement benefits based on their years of service.

## Ensuring job security 

Military civilian employees have legal protections that safeguard their job security. Although many states have at-will employment laws, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) protects the rights of military civilian employees in the event that they are fired, demoted, or suspended. MSPB has the authority to set aside adverse personnel actions that fail to meet legal or regulatory requirements or where there is evidence of discrimination or retaliation.

In addition, the Veterans Preference Act provides veterans with certain job security rights, such as preference in hiring and retention. This means that veterans are given priority consideration for hiring and retention decisions.

## Conclusion

Military civilian employees play a significant role in the success of the military, and their rights and protections under the law are just as important as those of uniformed service members. By understanding the various laws and protections in place for military civilian employees, one can protect themselves against discrimination, ensure fair pay and benefits, and maintain their job security.
