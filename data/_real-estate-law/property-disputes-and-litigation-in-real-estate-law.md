Real estate ownership comes with its fair share of benefits and challenges. While owning a property provides a sense of pride, it is not uncommon for disputes to arise between property owners regarding several areas. Disputes may occur between individuals, between individuals and the government, and between individuals and businesses. In such cases, litigation is the only way to find a fair resolution.

Here are some common types of property disputes that may require litigation under real estate law:

## Boundary Disputes

Disputes can arise regarding the exact boundary lines between properties. Boundary disputes can be immensely stressful, and the legal proceedings can be time-consuming and expensive. When identifying the boundary lines, individuals and lawyers often refer to old surveys, deeds, and other related documents.

## Nuisance

People generally expect peace and quiet in their homes. But when a neighbor’s activities become a nuisance, they can cause tension and lead to disputes. Activities such as playing loud music, constructing a large fence that infringes on the neighbor’s view, and allowing weeds to overrun the property and invade nearby land can be considered nuisances. Property owners have a responsibility to ensure that the activities on their site do not disturb their neighbors.

## Trespass

When an individual intentionally or unintentionally enters another person’s property without permission, it amounts to trespassing. Trespassing is a serious issue that can result in damage to a property, vandalism, and theft. Legal consequences of trespassing include fines, injunctions, and even criminal prosecution.

## Eminent Domain

Eminent domain refers to the right of the government to seize private property for public use. Under eminent domain laws, the government must offer a fair market price for the property. Disputes may arise when property owners believe that the amount offered by the government is insufficient.

## Landlord-Tenant Disputes

Landlord-tenant disputes may arise when the two parties can’t agree on the interpretation of the lease agreement. The lease may not specifically outline how tenants are allowed to use the property, making it difficult to enforce. Others may have disputes relating to rent, property maintenance, and eviction.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, owning a property brings immense pride, but it can also come with several challenges. Property disputes can be stressful and time-consuming. However, it is important to work with an experienced legal professional to ensure that your rights are protected in these types of disputes. Contact a real estate lawyer to help navigate you through property disputes and represent your interests in the event of litigation.
