Real estate transactions involve buying, selling, or leasing of property. It could be a house, a commercial building or a piece of land. These transactions can be complex and involve many legal aspects that need to be understood. In this article, we will discuss the legal aspects of residential and commercial real estate transactions.

## Residential Real Estate Transactions

Buying or selling a home involves several legal aspects that need to be understood to ensure that the transaction is legal and binding. Here is a list of some of the key legal aspects of residential real estate transactions:

- **Title search:** Before buying a residential property, you need to ensure that the seller has the legal right to sell the property. A title search can help you verify this information.
- **Inspections:** It is essential to have a home inspection to identify any issues such as leaks or structural problems.
- **Mortgage agreement:** If you are getting finance for your residential property, a mortgage agreement is a legally binding agreement between you and the lender.
- **Closing:** Closing means transferring the property ownership from the seller to the buyer. This process involves signing legal documents and exchanging money.

## Commercial Real Estate Transactions

Commercial real estate transactions are more complex than residential transactions, mainly because it involves larger sums of money and more parties. Here are some of the legal aspects involved in commercial real estate transactions:

- **Zoning and land use:** Commercial properties are subject to zoning and land use regulations. You need to understand these regulations to determine if the property meets your needs.
- **Environmental concerns:** You need to be aware of any environmental concerns such as contamination, as these can impact your purchase.
- **Lease agreement:** In commercial transactions, a lease agreement is often required. This agreement outlines the terms under which the property is leased.
- **Due diligence:** Before buying a commercial property, due diligence is essential to identify any factors that may affect the property's value.
