The sports industry is not immune to the influence of the gambling and gaming industry. In fact, the two industries often integrate with each other in various ways, from sports betting to online gaming apps featuring athletes' facsimiles.

In this article, we’ll discuss how gambling and gaming laws apply to the sports industry.

## The Rise of Sports Betting

Sports betting is one of the most significant driving factors of the gambling industry's growth. In the past, betting on sports was limited to horse racing or casinos. Today, sports betting is more popular than ever and is legal in some states of the USA.

This increased exposure to sports betting has raised legal concerns. Sports organizations are worried that allowing people to bet on their games may lead to corruption and unethical practices in the industry.

## The Impact of PASPA

PASPA (The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act) is a federal law that was passed in 1992. It banned sports betting in most states of the USA with some exceptions.

However, in May 2018, PASPA was overturned by the Supreme Court. This has opened the door for states to legalize sports betting, causing a plethora of legal concerns for sports leagues and states.

## Legal Concerns for Sports Leagues

Legalizing sports betting has caused many legal concerns for sports leagues.

One of the most significant concerns is the possibility of compromising the integrity of sports. The leagues want to prevent potential match-rigging and athlete corruption. They are concerned that athletes may be offered bribes to either underperform or encourage others on their team to underperform.

Another concern is player involvement in betting. Athletes are not allowed to bet on sports events or games. The leagues also want to make sure that the gambling industry does not exploit players' likenesses for profit.

## Gaming Law and its Impact on Sports

Gaming law mainly deals with online gaming and virtual worlds. Online gaming has become an incredibly popular industry in the last decade, and it regularly crosses over with the sports industry.

In recent years, online gaming apps featuring athletes have become trendy. These apps allow users to play online games with their favourite athletes. However, there may be legal concerns if athletes are being exploited or their likenesses misused.

Moreover, eSports competitions have emerged in recent years, which comprise video and online gaming tournaments. These competitions, just like physical sports events, require a set of rules and regulations to govern them. Gamers may also face contractual and employment issues that sports leagues face.

## Conclusion

The gambling and gaming industries exert a significant influence on sports, and the integration of these industries continues to evolve. It's essential to understand the legal implications of this integration and its impact on sports organizations, athletes, and players.

As we’ve discussed, legalizing sports betting raises many legal issues, including the possible corruption of the integrity of sports. Likewise, online gaming and eSports in the sports industry may create legal issues that need to be addressed. Therefore, it is crucial to continually evaluate and improve the legal framework that governs the sports industry in response to the latest developments in gambling and gaming.
