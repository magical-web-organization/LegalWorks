The United States has made great strides in recent years towards protecting the rights of the LGBT community. However, discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation and gender identity continue to be significant issues in many areas of American society. It is important for individuals to understand their legal rights and protections under civil rights law, and to seek the help of experienced legal professionals in cases of discrimination or harassment.

## Legal Protections

Over the past several decades, lawmakers and courts in the United States have recognized that LGBT individuals are protected by civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination and harassment based on race, religion, sex, and other protected characteristics. Specifically, the following legal protections apply to members of the LGBT community:

### Title VII of the Civil Rights Act

 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. In June 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Title VII also protects LGBT individuals from employment discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.

### Fair Housing Act

The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, and disability. Most courts now interpret this to include discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

### Education Amendments 

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination in education, including discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This protection applies to all schools that receive federal funding.

### States and Local Laws

Many states and municipalities have implemented civil rights laws or ordinances that extend protections to LGBT individuals in areas such as housing, employment, and public accommodations.

## Discrimination 

Despite these legal protections, discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation and gender identity still occur frequently in the United States. LGBT individuals may face discrimination in the following areas:

### Employment

Employers may discriminate against LGBT individuals in the hiring process or in the workplace.

### Housing

Landlords may refuse to rent to LGBT individuals, or may evict them based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.

### Public Accommodations 

LGBT individuals may also face discrimination in public accommodations, such as restaurants, hotels, and transportation services.

## Legal Action

Individuals who experience discrimination or harassment based on their sexual orientation or gender identity may have legal recourse under civil rights law. This may include filing a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), pursuing a lawsuit in court, or seeking mediation or arbitration.

It is important for individuals to seek the help of experienced legal professionals in these situations. An experienced attorney can help individuals understand their legal rights and options, and can provide representation in court or during mediation or other proceedings.

### Conclusion

LGBT individuals in the United States have made significant progress in securing legal protections against discrimination and harassment. However, this does not mean that discrimination and harassment have been eradicated. It is still important for individuals to understand their legal rights and protections, and to seek the help of experienced legal professionals if they believe that they have experienced discrimination or harassment based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. With legal support, individuals can take a stand against discrimination and work towards a more just and equal society.
