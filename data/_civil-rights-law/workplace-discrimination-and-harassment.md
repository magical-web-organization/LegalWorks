Discrimination and harassment can create a hostile work environment that hinders productivity, morale, and the well-being of affected employees. Under civil rights law, discrimination and harassment are strictly prohibited, and there are legal remedies available to victims of such workplace misconduct.

## What is Workplace Discrimination?

Workplace discrimination occurs when an employee is treated unfavorably based on their membership in a protected category, such as race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, or disability. Discrimination can take various forms, including:

- Refusing to hire or promote an employee
- Paying someone less than what they deserve
- Assigning substandard or undesirable work
- Excluding someone from training or development opportunities
- Termination or retaliation

## What is Workplace Harassment?

Workplace harassment involves conduct that creates a hostile or offensive work environment. Harassment can be based on any protected category and can take many forms, including:

- Verbal, physical, or visual conduct
- Off-color jokes, slurs, or epithets
- Offensive emails or social media posts
- Sexual advances or propositions
- Intimidation, bullying or threats

If an employee experiences workplace harassment or discrimination, they are entitled to seek legal recourse. The following are some strategies to combat discrimination and harassment in the workplace.

## Strategies to Combat Workplace Discrimination and Harassment

### Understand Your Legal Rights

Employees need to know their rights under civil rights law to be able to identify and report incidents of discrimination and harassment. Employers have a legal obligation to maintain a workplace free from discrimination and harassment. By understanding one's rights and the legal responsibilities of employers, employees become empowered to seek justice if needed.

### Report Incidents of Discrimination and Harassment

Employees who experience discrimination or harassment in the workplace should report it to their supervisor or human resources department immediately. Employers need to investigate complaints of harassment and discrimination and take prompt corrective action to prevent future incidents.

### Document Incidents of Discrimination and Harassment

Employees should document all incidents of harassment or discrimination, including dates, times, witnesses, and the nature of the conduct. Documentation can provide evidence to support the employee's complaint and establish a pattern of harassment or discrimination.

### Seek Legal Counsel

If an employee's employer fails to address their complaint, or their complaints are ignored or not taken seriously, it may be prudent to seek legal counsel. An employment attorney can provide legal guidance and representation in filing a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or a state human rights agency.

## Final Thoughts

Discrimination and harassment in the workplace are illegal practices that are intolerable under civil rights law. Employees who experience such conduct have legal protections and remedies under the law. If you are a victim of workplace discrimination or harassment, be sure to take timely and appropriate action to protect your rights and seek legal counsel if needed.
