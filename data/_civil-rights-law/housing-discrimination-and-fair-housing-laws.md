Housing discrimination is an unfortunate but common occurrence in the United States. Discrimination can take many forms, including refusal to rent or sell, differential treatment, unequal terms, and more. The Fair Housing Act (FHA) of 1968 was created to protect citizens from such forms of discrimination when trying to purchase or rent a home.

## What is Housing Discrimination?

Housing discrimination is when an individual or group is treated unfairly when trying to purchase or rent a home. Discrimination exists in many forms, including:

- Refusal to rent or sell
- Differential treatment
- Unequal terms
- Harassment
- Intimidation
- Other discriminatory practices

Discrimination can take many forms, but it always has the same negative effect: preventing individuals and families from accessing housing opportunities due to subjective decisions based on race, religion, gender, sexuality, or disability. 

## Fair Housing Laws

The FHA became law in 1968 and prohibits discrimination in the sale or rental of housing based on color, religion, national origin, sex, disability, and familial status. The law applies to nearly all housing situations, including single-family homes, apartments, and mobile homes.

Additionally, several states and municipalities have their own anti-discrimination laws that go beyond what the FHA requires. Depending on where you live, you may have additional protection against discrimination based on age, sexual orientation, gender identity, or other characteristics. 

## Remedies for Discrimination

If you believe that you have been the victim of housing discrimination, there are several actions that you can take:

1. File a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD is responsible for enforcing the FHA and has investigators who review claims of discrimination.

2. File a lawsuit in federal or state court. You may be entitled to damages, which could include compensation for any financial loss or harm caused by the discrimination.

3. Seek assistance from a fair housing organization. These organizations often provide legal assistance and counseling to individuals who have faced housing discrimination.

## Conclusion

Housing discrimination is a form of discrimination that denies individuals and families the opportunity to access housing based on arbitrary and subjective factors. Fortunately, the FHA and other fair housing laws protect citizens from discrimination in housing. If you have faced housing discrimination, you have options for recourse, and it is important to take action to protect your rights.
