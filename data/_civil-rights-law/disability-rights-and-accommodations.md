Disability Rights refer to the legal protections provided to individuals with disabilities against discrimination in various aspects of life. Disability rights cover various areas of life, including employment, housing, education, transportation, and voting rights. One of the essential components of disability rights is the requirement of reasonable accommodations by employers and public entities to enable individuals with disabilities to participate fully in society.

## The Various Protections

There are several federal and state laws that protect individuals with disabilities from discrimination, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act. 

## Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

The ADA is a federal law that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in various aspects of life. The ADA requires employers with 15 or more employees to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities to enable them to perform their job functions. Under the ADA, public entities, such as schools and government agencies, must provide reasonable accommodations to individuals with disabilities to enable them to access their programs and services.

## Rehabilitation Act

The Rehabilitation Act is another federal law that provides protections for individuals with disabilities. The Rehabilitation Act prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. This law requires employers and public entities receiving federal funding to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities.

## Reasonable Accommodations

Reasonable accommodations refer to any modifications or adjustments to a job, environment, or program that enable an individual with a disability to perform their job functions or participate in a program or activity. Reasonable accommodations must be provided when the accommodation will not cause undue hardship on the employer or public entity.

Examples of reasonable accommodations may include modified work hours, assistive technology, flexible work locations, or modified job duties. Public entities may be required to provide accessible entrances, signage, and auxiliary aids such as interpreters or captions for individuals with hearing or visual impairments.

## Conclusion

Disability rights protections and reasonable accommodations are essential components of civil rights law. These laws protect individuals with disabilities from discrimination and enable them to participate fully in society. If you have a disability and are in need of assistance, legal help is available to ensure you are protected and can access the accommodations you need.
