Employment law covers a wide range of legal disputes that can arise between employers and employees. When these disputes occur, employees have several options available for resolving the issue. One of these options is arbitration and mediation. In this article, we will discuss the concept of employment-related arbitration and mediation and why it is essential to understand as an employee.

## What is employment-related arbitration and mediation?

Arbitration and mediation are alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods. These often serve as an alternative to litigation. Both forms of ADR aim to resolve disputes outside of the traditional court system proceeding.

Arbitration involves a third-party arbitrator or panel of arbitrators who evaluate the evidence and dispute to reach a decision. Arbitration may be binding or non-binding. In binding arbitration, the parties agree to accept the arbitrator's decision as final and binding. In contrast, in non-binding arbitration, the parties can reject the arbitrator's decision and take the dispute to court.

On the other hand, mediation involves a neutral third party who helps both parties negotiate a mutually acceptable settlement. Mediation does not involve imposing a decision, but rather facilitates a conversation to find a mutually agreeable solution. Mediation is a non-binding ADR method.

## Why is it essential to understand employment-related arbitration and mediation?

As an employee, it is essential to understand employment-related arbitration and mediation to decide what path to take in resolving work-related disputes. Here are some of the reasons why you should be familiar with these ADR methods:

### Cost-effective

Litigation can be time-consuming and costly. Arbitration and mediation offer a more cost-effective way of resolving disputes. The process is less formal, and the proceedings take less time than traditional court proceedings.

### Confidentiality

Arbitration and mediation proceedings are private and confidential. This aspect is especially important in disputes that may have sensitive information about an employee or employer.

### Expertise

Arbitrators and mediators have experience in resolving specific types of disputes. They are typically experts in employment law, so they can evaluate the evidence and provide an informed decision.

### Speed

Arbitration and mediation proceedings are typically fast, and it may be faster than traditional litigation. This aspect can sometimes be a significant advantage for the parties, especially when they need to resolve the dispute in a timely manner.

### Control

In arbitration and mediation, both parties have more control over the process than in litigation. The parties can choose an arbitrator or mediator, and they may have a say in how the proceedings will be structured.

### Finality

In binding arbitration, the decision is final and binding. This finality prevents either party from dragging out the dispute further.

## Conclusion

Employment-related arbitration and mediation are essential ADR methods for resolving disputes between employees and employers. As an employee, it is crucial to understand the process and benefits of these methods so you can make an informed decision about how to proceed with a dispute. By considering the advantages and shortcomings of arbitration and mediation, employees can determine whether these methods are appropriate based on their unique case.
