As an employee, you have the right to work in an environment free from harassment and discrimination. Unfortunately, workplace harassment and a hostile work environment are all too common in many industries. These types of unlawful behavior can cause emotional distress and negatively impact an employee's mental health, productivity, and job satisfaction. In this article, we'll provide an overview of what constitutes workplace harassment and hostile work environments under employment law and what you can do to protect your rights as an employee.

## What Is Workplace Harassment?

Workplace harassment is any behavior that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. It can take many forms, including:

- Verbal harassment, such as insults or derogatory comments
- Physical harassment, such as unwanted touching or sexual advances
- Visual harassment, such as posters or images that are offensive or inappropriate
- Psychological harassment, such as bullying, intimidation, or threats

These behaviors, whether they are aimed at an individual or a group, can be devastating to an employee's mental and emotional health. They can also have a significant impact on work performance, leading to lost productivity, absenteeism, and turnover.

## What Is a Hostile Work Environment?

A hostile work environment is a type of workplace harassment that involves pervasive and severe behavior that interferes with an employee's ability to do their job. This type of situation can be created by a co-worker, a supervisor, or even a vendor or customer. Examples of behavior that can contribute to a hostile work environment include:

- Jokes or comments that are sexual, racial, or religious in nature
- Physical touching or unwanted advances
- Bullying, intimidation, or threats
- Ridicule or mockery of an employee's appearance, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation

If you're experiencing a hostile work environment, it's important to understand that you have legal rights to protect you. However, it's also important to take action quickly to preserve evidence and protect yourself from further harm.

## Legal Implications of Workplace Harassment and Hostile Work Environment

Workplace harassment and a hostile work environment are unlawful activities under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This Act prevents employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. If you're being harassed because of your membership in one of these categories (or any other legally protected characteristic), you have the right to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The EEOC will investigate the complaint and take appropriate action against the employer if necessary.

In addition to the EEOC, many states have their own laws and regulations that protect employees from harassment and discrimination. If you believe your state has stronger protections than are provided under federal law, it's essential to work with an employment attorney who is familiar with your state's laws.

## Protecting Your Rights as an Employee

If you're experiencing workplace harassment or a hostile work environment, it's important to document the behavior, report it to your supervisor, and seek legal advice. Here's what you should do:

- Keep a detailed record of the harassment or hostile work environment, including dates, times, and any witnesses.
- Report the behavior to your supervisor or the human resources department. Follow up in writing to document the complaint.
- If you don't receive a response from your employer or don't feel comfortable reporting the behavior internally, contact an employment lawyer who can advise you on your legal options.
- If you do report the behavior and your employer doesn't take appropriate action, you may have grounds for a lawsuit against the company.

Remember, you have the right to work in an environment free from harassment and discrimination. If you're being subjected to unlawful behavior in the workplace, it's important to take action to protect your rights and your well-being.
