If you believe that you have been a victim of employment discrimination, it is important to know your rights and what steps you can take to protect them.

## Protecting Your Rights

If you believe that you have been discriminated against based on your race, gender, age, religion or disability, there are steps you can take to protect your legal rights. 

1. File a Complaint: You can file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or your state's labor department. They will investigate your claim and may take legal action on your behalf. 
2. Get Legal Help: You may want to consult with an experienced employment discrimination attorney who can advise you on your legal options and represent you in court if necessary.
3. Keep Records: It is important to keep detailed records of any incidents or actions that you believe were discriminatory. This can include emails, memos, performance reviews, or witness statements.

By taking these steps, you can protect your legal rights and hold employers accountable for discriminatory behavior. It is important to note that there are strict time limits for filing discrimination claims, so it is important to act quickly if you believe that you have been a victim of discrimination.
