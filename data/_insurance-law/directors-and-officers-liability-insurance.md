Directors and Officers Liability Insurance, commonly referred to as D&O insurance, is a type of coverage that can be crucial for businesses to protect their directors and officers against legal expenses in the event of a lawsuit against them.

## What is D&O Insurance?

D&O insurance is designed to protect the personal assets of directors and officers and to reimburse the company for any costs or damages that arise as a result of legal action taken against them for alleged wrongful acts or mismanagement. This can include things like breach of duty, fraud, negligence, and other alleged violations of the law.

## Who is Covered by D&O Insurance?

D&O insurance typically covers directors and officers, as well as any other employees or representatives of the company who could be held liable for the actions of the company. This can include managers, supervisors, and other high-ranking officials.

- Legal fees and court costs

- Internal investigations and legal expenses

It is important to note that D&O insurance typically does not cover intentional or criminal acts, nor does it cover bodily injury or property damage claims.
